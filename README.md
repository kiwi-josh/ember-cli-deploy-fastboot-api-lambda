# ember-cli-deploy-fastboot-api-lambda

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ember-cli-deploy-fastboot-api-lambda.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/ember-cli-deploy-fastboot-api-lambda)

An ambitious ember-cli-deploy plugin for serving Ember FastBoot Applications entirely from within AWS Lambda/API Gateway (assets and all!).


## Background
API Gateway [now supports the handling binary payloads](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/11/binary-data-now-supported-by-api-gateway/), which means an end-to-end fastboot hosting solution can now be achieved through API gateway and Lambda without the use of S3 for serving static files. This is what this addon aims to achieve.

## Prerequisites 
- You have [ember-fastboot](https://ember-fastboot.com) installed and configured within your Ember app.
- You have an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free) setup.
- You have the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli) installed and configured.

## Installation

* Install the ember-cli-deploy addons
```
ember install ember-cli-deploy
ember install ember-cli-deploy-build
ember install ember-cli-deploy-fastboot-api-lambda
```

## Configuration

* Configure the deployment variables
```
// config/deploy.js
ENV['fastboot-api-lambda'] = {
  accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,         // (Required) AWS accessKeyId (must have permission to deploy lambda functions)
  secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, // (Required) AWS secretAccessKey
  lambdaFunction: 'my-ember-app',                     // (Required) Lambda functions name
  region: 'us-east-1',                                // (Required) Region where lambda is deployed

  fallbackPath: '/'                                   // (optional) The route that will be attempted if the current route fails. i.e. doesn't exist, fails etc.
  stringyExtensions: [                                // (optional) The file extensions that will be treated as text and not binary. Defaults are shown. Any additional items will be concatenated to this list.
    'html',
    'css',
    'js',
    'json',
    'xml',
    'ico',
    'txt',
    'map'
  ],
  validAssetPaths: [                                  // (optional) The assets paths that the lambda is explicitly allow serve. Defaults are shown. Any additional items will be concatenated to this list.
    '/assets/',
    '/robots.txt',
    '/humans.txt',
    '/crossdomain.xml',
    '/sitemap.xml'
  ]
};
```

* Create the lambda function
    
  * Open the [AWS Lambda console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda). 
  * Select the region that you defined in your deploy variables above.
  * Create a blank lambda, with the name you defined in your deploy variables above.
    * Handler => `index.handler`.
    * Role => `Create a custom role`. Give it a name and use the default policy document.
    * Memory => `128`.
    * Timeout => `30 seconds`.
  * Select `Next` and then select `Create function`. 

* Create the API Gateway Proxy
  
  * Open the [AWS API Gateway console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway). 
  * Select the region that you defined in your deploy variables above.
  * Select `New API` and give it a name
  * Select Binary Support. Click `Edit`. Add `*/*` and click `Save`.
  * Create proxy method:
    * Under resources, click `/`, then click `Actions => Create Method`. Select `Any`.
    * Click the `Any label`, choose Integration type `lambda`, check the `Use Lambda Proxy integration` checkbox, and finally select your lambda function's region and name.
  * Create proxy resource:
    * Under resources, click `/`, then click `Actions => Create Resource`. Select `Any`.
    * Select `Configure as proxy resource`, and select `Enable API Gateway CORS`.
    * Select Integration type `Lambda Function Proxy`, and finally select your lambda function's region and name.
  * Under resources, click `Actions => Deploy API`. Select a new stage and give it the name `fastboot`. Hit `Deploy`. You will now see the `Invoke URL`. This is where you site will be hosted.

* Ember Application
  * The `rootURL` must match the stage name you selected when creating the api gateway. Otherwise the `link-to` helper wont work.
  ```
  // config/environment.js
  var ENV = {
    rootURL: '/fastboot/'
  }
  ```

* Configuration is done! ðŸŽ‰

## Deployment

Is as simple as going:

`ember deploy production --activate --verbose=true`


## Caveats

Just a word of warning.. just because this architecture is possible, doesn't make it the optimal for all use-cases.
Lambda functions suffer from a cold start delay, which can make response times unpredictable.
